TAE Week 4 Coaching Guide
Agents, MCP, and the Incident Command Capstone
The AI Engineer Program
November 23, 2025
Abstract
Week 4 moves from “model reasoning” to production-grade agent sys-
tems. You will pair theAI Agents & Automation book/slideswith
Part III of the Engineering bookand the newMCP Capstone
Note. The capstone delivers a practical “Incident Command Agent”
that runs on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), orchestrates real tools,
captures telemetry, and documents memory. This guide distills what to
study, how to pace yourself, and how to review MCP-specific concepts
before building the capstone.

1 Purpose & Scope (Week 4)
This guide coaches you through Week 4, where the spotlight shifts to agentic systems, or-
chestration, and the MCP-based Incident Command capstone. Focus on theAI Agents &
Automation book/slides[1, 2], Engineering book Part III + slides[3, 4], theMCP
Capstone Note[5], and the course schedule [6].
Week 4 Outcomes
By the end of the week you should be able to: (1) explain the Ob-
serve → Plan → Act → Learn loop and memory touchpoints, (2) implement and instru-
ment an MCP server that advertises tools/resources, (3) build a planner/orchestrator
that respects budgets and telemetry, and (4) deliver the Incident Command capstone
with logs, replay traces, and documentation.
2 Core Resources
This section lists the Week 4 documents you should keep open. Skim each before deep dives so
you always know where to look for clarification while building the capstone.
• AI Agents & Automation Book (age.html)[1] — conceptual foundations, loop
anatomy, and system patterns.
• AI Agents Slides (age_slides.pdf)[2] — high-level framing; use for quick refreshers
before study blocks.
1
• Engineering Book, Part III (eng.html)[3] — retrieval, orchestration, scaling, and
guardrails that ground the capstone.
• Engineering Slides, Part III (eng_slides.pdf)[4] — condensed checklists for observ-
ability, evaluation, and deployment.
• MCP Capstone Note (mcp_agents.pdf)[5] — detailed briefing on MCP fundamen-
tals, capstone goals, and step-by-step implementation hints.
• Program Schedule (schedule.html)[6] — suggested pacing, submission reminders,
and context for Week 4 milestones.
3 What You Will Learn
Glance through the bullets below whenever you need to re-anchor your study plan; they capture
the essential skills Week 4 expects you to practice.
• Loop discipline: Observe→ Plan → Act → Learn instrumentation + memory deltas
[1].
• MCP basics: JSON-RPC handshake, resource listings, tool invocation schemas, teleme-
try fields [5].
• Tool engineering: adapters with validation, auth, sandboxing, metrics, and error prop-
agation [3].
• Planner/orchestrator design: FSM vs. LLM planner, budget enforcement, replay log-
ging, correlation IDs [1, 3, 5].
• Applied case study: map these ideas onto the Incident Command narrative so you can
later design tools/resources with confidence [1, 5].
4 How to Study
Pick the track that fits your schedule and stick to short, focused loops. Each plan balances
reading, coding, and engineering hygiene so the capstone never drifts.
Full-Time Track (3–4 h/day)
Use weekdays to absorb the texts and reserve the weekend for concentrated capstone sprints.
• Mon–Tue (study): Agents book/slides on loop anatomy, memory, planner patterns;
redraw the Observe→ Plan → Act → Learn table in your own words [1, 2].
• Wed–Thu (study): Engineering book/slides Part III (retrieval, orchestration, scaling);
list the telemetry/budget metrics you will enforce [3, 4].
• Fri (bridge): MCP note protocol + demo server/client; narrate each JSON-RPC ex-
change and outline your custom tools/resources [5].
• Sat (build): Implement the MCP server, expose resources (alerts/runbooks/memory),
and ship retrieval/diagnostic/summarizer tools.
• Sun (integrate): Add planner/orchestrator logic, telemetry, replay traces, and docu-
mentation; run one full loop end-to-end.
2
Time-Constrained (60–90 min/day)
Even with limited time you can study during the week and save the heavy lifting for the weekend.
• Mon: Skim Agents book/slides for loop + memory; capture a one-paragraph summary
[1, 2].
• Tue: Read Engineering book Part III overview; note the guardrails/telemetry you will
log [3, 4].
• Wed: Work through the MCP note protocol overview and run the demo server/client
once [5].
• Thu: Draft your Incident Command design (resources, tools, planner states) and prep
configs/secrets.
• Fri evening: Set up the repo/venv and scaffold the MCP server entrypoint.
• Weekend: Saturday for implementing server + tools + resources; Sunday for plan-
ner/memory/logging, replay validation, and README polish.
5 Focus First (Priorities)
These study priorities help you master the Week 4 material before touching the weekend cap-
stone build.
• Loop & memory fundamentals: Revisit the Observe→ Plan → Act → Learn loop
tables and memory notes in the Agents book/slides; be ready to explain each stage from
memory [1, 2].
• Engineering guardrails: Read Engineering Part III sections on retrieval/orchestra-
tion/scalingwithemphasisontelemetry, budgets, andevaluation; summarizetheguardrails
you will reuse [3, 4].
• MCP protocol trace: Study the MCP note’s JSON-RPC handshake/resource/tool flow;
manually trace one demo session and annotate every request/response [5].
• Tool/resource design: Draft schemas for alerts, runbooks, diagnostics, and summaries;
ensure inputs/outputs/metrics are explicit before you code.
• Telemetry & replay mindset: Decide how you will log correlation IDs, budgets, and
memory deltas; reread the relevant Engineering sections so instrumentation feels natural
once you start building [3].
6 Key Concepts — Concise Recap
Use these mini-cheat-sheets to refresh the main ideas before debugging or refactoring.
Observe → Plan → Act → Learn
• Treat each stage as a contract: observation payload, planner decision, tool invocation,
memory delta [1].
• Memory participates throughout (read before planning, write after acting); stray facts
belong in structured deltas, not ad-hoc text [1].
3
MCP Fundamentals
• JSON-RPC 2.0 handshake (initialize), getResource, andcallTool; reuse unique IDs
for correlation [5].
• Capabilities advertise tool schemas + resource URIs; clients cache them before planning
[5].
• Responses must include data + metrics (latency, cost, status) so budgets and dashboards
stay accurate [3, 5].
Tooling & Telemetry
• Wrap every tool in an adapter that validates input, enforces timeouts, and records laten-
cy/result/side effects [3].
• Record budgets (tokens, ms, dollars) per loop; raise guardrails when thresholds trigger
[3].
Engineering Systems View (Part III)
• Retrieval + Orchestration: pair local knowledge sources with LLM/tool calls; always plan
for provenance and guardrails [3, 4].
• Scaling + Reliability: monitor latency/cost, add caching/batching, and define fallback
paths before deployment [3].
• Evaluation + Governance: log inputs/outputs, tag runs, and create lightweight regression
checks so agents remain auditable [3, 4].
7 Review Questions
Answer these prompts in writing or code; they double as lightweight retrospectives on your
current progress.
• Outline the data included in each Observe→ Plan → Act → Learn stage for an incident-
response agent.
• Describe the JSON schema for one of your tools. Which fields carry telemetry and how
are errors reported?
• How do you persist memory deltas? Show the structure of one entry and how the planner
reads it back.
• Which budgets do you enforce (latency, cost, tokens, retries)? How do you surface budget
breaches?
• How would you replay a recorded session without touching live tools? Which files/com-
mands are involved?
8 Practice Checklist
Before dedicating the weekend to implementation, confirm these study exercises are complete.
• Recreate the Observe→ Plan → Act → Learn table from memory and explain each stage
aloud.
4
• Summarize (in your notebook) the telemetry/guardrail recommendations from Engineer-
ing Part III that you will reuse [3].
• Trace the MCP demo session request-by-request (initialize, getResource, callTool) and
annotate what each field means [5].
• Run the demo MCP server/client end-to-end; capture one transcript so you can reference
the JSON-RPC flow later [5].
• Write a half-page design brief describing your planned resources, tools, planner states, and
logging strategy.
9 Daily Cadence (Example)
Here is a sample pacing plan for weekdays. Use the weekend for the capstone sprints outlined
earlier.
Block Focus Resource
45–60 min Loop + memory study age.html, age slides
30–45 min Engineering guardrails eng.html/eng_slides (Part III)
20–30 min MCP protocol + journaling MCP note + personal run log
10 Capstone Project (Week 4)
The Incident Command Agent is the Week 4 deliverable. Keep these guardrails in mind while
you design, build, and document your submission. Deliver anIncident Command Agentthat
speaks MCP. The server must expose resources (alerts, runbooks, memory) and tools (retrieval,
diagnostics, summarizer). Theclient/orchestratorcyclesthroughObserve→Plan→Act→Learn,
enforces budgets, records telemetry, and produces human-readable summaries or escalations.
Provide:
• Code: MCP server + orchestrator CLI (or notebook) runnable locally; configuration
documented.
• Artifacts: sample logs/replays, memory snapshots, example transcripts, and instructions
for reproducing the demo.
• Write-up: short README describing scenario, tooling, budgets, and how to extend the
agent.
11 Key Coaching Prompts
Ask yourself the following questions to challenge your understanding and uncover any weak
spots before building.
• Can I explain the last three memory deltas — what triggered them and how the planner
uses them?
• For one chosen tool, can I state its JSON schema, telemetry fields, and the tests I would
run in isolation?
• Can I narrate a full loop, mentioning every MCP request/response and where I log each
event?
• If latency suddenly doubles, what metrics or dashboards would reveal the cause, and how
would I respond?

12 Troubleshooting Guide
If something breaks, scan this table before diving into a long debugging session. Most Week 4
issues fall into these buckets.
• Handshake fails: confirm server is running, subprotocol set tomcp, and messages include
jsonrpc=2.0.
• Schema mismatch: log incoming payloads; add pydantic/jsonschema validation before
executing tools.
• Planner loops forever: enforce max steps; log budget counters and break on repetition.
• Memory drift: timestamp every write; include summary + raw data; add tests that
load/replay memory entries.
13 Final Checks Before Submission
Run through this checklist before you package your capstone. It ensures reproducibility and
professional polish.
• Run a fresh session end-to-end with logging enabled; archive the transcript.
• Verify README instructions on a clean environment (new venv or Codespace).
• Ensure secrets/configs are externalized (env vars, .env, or config files ignored by git).
• Provide evidence (screenshots or logs) showing budgets, telemetry, and human handoff
text.
